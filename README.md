# spacesettlers
Spacewar/Spacesettlers game used by the AI class at the University of Oklahoma

This project stores the source code for the game Space Settlers, formerly known as Spacewar. This game is used to teach Artificial Intelligence at the University of Oklahoma. The game enables students to implement their own search, learning, multi-agent, and planning systems within a complex real-world type environment. They also learn how to use existing software packages. You are welcome to use this software in your class! Please cite one of the papers below.  Additional documentation is available on the github wiki pages and through the javadocs.
